### Contribution Guidelines:

#### Code Style
MinigameCore follows the [Sponge Code Conventions](https://docs.spongepowered.org/master/en/contributing/implementation/codestyle.html).

#### Submitting your Pull Requests
In your PRs, please make sure you fulfill the following:

* Provide a justification for the change - is it a new feature or a fix to a bug?
* Before sending a pull request ensure that your branch is up to date with the branch you are targeting. This should
normally be master.
* Do not squash commits unless directed to do so, but please _rebase_ your changes on top of master when you feel your
changes are ready to be submitted - _do not merge_. We will squash the commits in a way we feel logical.
